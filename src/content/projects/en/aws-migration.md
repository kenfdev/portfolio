Planned and tested solutions to migrate a B2C service from a Japanese cloud provider to AWS. Including a NAS migration from a single LVM node to a DRBD cluster with 2 nodes using LVM. In addition, converting provisioning shell scripts to Ansible and automating AWS resource deployment with Terraform. While it took days to prepare a full environment, using Terraform and Ansible shortened it to hours.
