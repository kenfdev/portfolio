I'm a web developer with more than 10+ years' experience in developing enterprise applications. I love communicating with colleagues and solving issues in order to be as productive as possible. Always looking for ways to improve things (process, tools, technologies, etc.) and applying them step by step.

My area of expertise is in modern front-end architecture, but I am always aware of the back-end, CI/CD pipeline and everything related to delivering the product.

I also have a huge passion for contributing to Open Source Software. Filing bugs, solving issues, helping newcomers is what I enjoy in my spare time. I was born in the United States and came to Japan when I was 10, so am fluent with both English and Japanese.
