Hello! I'm Ken, a software engineer with a passion for building scalable, reliable systems. I specialize in backend development, cloud infrastructure, and developer tooling.

Currently focused on distributed systems, containerization, and infrastructure automation. I enjoy solving complex problems and sharing knowledge through open-source contributions and technical writing.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to community projects, or learning about system design patterns.
